## Description

This is a simple memory game app that I created as a part of my Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree.

There are 8 pairs of cards on the board (each pair has the same symbol). Click on a card to flip it over and see its symbol. Test your memory by matching all the pairs!

The game displays the time it takes you to match all the pairs, how many moves it takes you, and a star rating.
3 stars = solved puzzle in less than 35 moves
2 stars = solved puzzle in less than or equal to 45 moves
1 star = solved puzzle in more than 45 moves
