## Description

This is a simple memory game app that I created as a part of my Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree.

There are 8 pairs of tiles on the board (each pair has the same symbol). Click on a tile to flip it over and see its symbol. Test your memory by matching all the pairs!


## Setup

To play the game, download this repository as a .zip file. Then, unzip it and open index.html in a browser of your choice.

Start playing by clicking on any of the light blue tiles! If at any point you want to restart the game, click on "Start Over."

## Rules of the Game

There are 16 tiles on the board, consisting of 8 pairs of tiles. A pair of tiles will have the same symbol.

Click on two tiles at a time:
* When you click on tiles that match, they will stay flipped over.
* When you click on tiles that don't match, they will flip back over quickly.

Your objective is to match all 8 pairs in as few moves and as quickly as you can!

## Player Statistics

The game keeps track of and displays the number of moves you have made (which is the number of tiles you have flipped over), how long it takes you to find all the matching pairs, and a star rating which is determined as follows:

- 3 stars = solved puzzle in less than 35 moves
- 2 stars = solved puzzle in more than 35 moves but less than or equal to 45 moves
- 1 star = solved puzzle in more than 45 moves
